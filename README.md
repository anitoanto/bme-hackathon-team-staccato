# Brit Wave - Team Staccato

This project is a working prototype developed during the British Music Experience Hackathon. It integrates music data analysis, including curated datasets with music metadata and embeddings. The project provides insights into music content, including audio and lyric-based embeddings, and calculates related distances for music analysis.

## Key Features

- **React UI**: Interactive user interface for browsing and analyzing music.
- **Data Analysis**: Analysis over a curated music dataset, generating insights and metrics.
- **Embeddings**: Vector embeddings for both music audio and lyrics.
- **Music Database**: Contains detailed metadata and analysis results of music data.

## Database Details

- **music_lib**: Collection of music metadata.
- **music_emb**: Vector embeddings for each audio track.
- **lyrics_emb**: Vector embeddings for each lyric set.
- **music_dist**: Distances based on audio and lyric analysis.
